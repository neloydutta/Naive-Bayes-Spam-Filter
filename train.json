( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf\ndear shareholder , addlrko\ni am writing to you today to\ndiscuss the new direction which your company will be\nheading . up until this point we made it clear that\nabdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of\nthe market . our basic premise was to seek out\ncompanies that can be turned into positive cash flow\nbusinesses with the proper equity investment made into\nthem by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ;\nwith a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we\nexpect fine wein to be able to throw off significant\npositive cash flow over the next 12 months from the\nvarious projects they are currently working on .\ne - direct is another example ; we should start to see\nsome meaningful positive cash flow developing and\ncontinuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has\nnot maintained a particular industry focus . as of\ntoday that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir\nlast week we announced that abdv\nwill be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to\nfuture quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) ,\na company in the oil gas sector , this was the start\nof our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in\nlocating and provide managerial , accounting and\nfinancing for companies in the energy field , from oil\nand gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft\nyou may ask ; why the energy\nrelated field ? simply it currently offers many\nopportunities and with the price of oil approaching\n$ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth\nto be made in this sector . according to adjusted\ninflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak\nof $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis\nof the past , we are looking at what will be a problem\nto stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand\nfor oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this\nyear alone , most of which is because of china . the\nincrease in oil prices is not a fade which once the\nbubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30\nlevel . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented\nin stone . there are more players in the world economy\ntoday that require oil gas to propel their own\neconomies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at\nthese higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself\nwith individuals that have experience in the energy\nfield . these individuals will help locate viable\nopportunities and the funding necessary to participate\nin these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira\nso what do we do with our\nnon - energy related businesses such as fine wein\nrecords and e - direct ? well , first of all we will\ncontinue to incubate and nurture these businesses\nuntil they are at a level where they can move on their\nown . i believe that both of these companies will be\nstrong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at\nthat point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of\ndirectors that we spin - off these two businesses to our\nshareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the\nbasic premise of our business module whereby we share\nthe wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing\npublic our portfolio companies . we can then continue\nto concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw\nby concentrating on a specific\nsector such as the energy area we will be able to\ndefine abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our\ngoal will be to locate and make investments in no less\nthan four energy - related businesses over the next 12\nmonths . i believe that by maintaining this focus an\ninvestment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative\nway to participate in the booming oil gas and\nenergy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm\nfine wein records , inc .\nannounces compilation music deal for theworld - renowned ` i love ny ' logo\nfine wein records , inc . , a subsidiary of atlantis business development\ncorporation , inc .

the company : p\ndelta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration\ncompany that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres\n( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all\nlocated over what management considers to be some of the most\nprospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states .\nanother 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are\ncontrolled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed\nthat the bolivian properties display similar potential to those\nfound in north america . p\nthe management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry\nrayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration\ncompany to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of\nexperience in the field of geology , along with running some of the\nmost successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was\nthe president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a\nmarket cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated\nwith glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp\nminerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector\nalong with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an\nextraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company\nmoves forward . p\namong the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30\nyears experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa ,\nsouth america and the united states . while with gold fields mining\ncorp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent\ndrilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p\ndelta has experienced significant technical success since its\nstart - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first\nin - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead\nkimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part\nof the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown\nthe three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator\nminerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic\ndiamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p\nan aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to\ndiscover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this\nunder - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing\nkimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p\nin bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly\nprospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia\ngroup of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other\none - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to\nthe independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres\ncomprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays\nall the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further\nexploration is justified . p\ndelta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing\nits extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also\nby acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on\nidentifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining\ncompanies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and\nfinance additional exploration . p\nin addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta\ncontrols , they also control a gold property with great potential .\nthe property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis\nrevealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an\nextensive exploration program . pp\n( source : company website ) p\nrecent headlines : go online and read the
